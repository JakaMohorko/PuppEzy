# PuppEzy

Bachelor's degree honours project at The University of Edinburgh.

Learning game built in Unity, aimed at teaching players the basics of the Puppet configuration language. The game contains 6 levels, each teaching new knowledge and building upon material taught in previous levels. Each level presents a puzzle where players must specify a Puppet manifest which results in the desired system configuration.

## Description

With a large amount of new system administrators entering the occupation, the need for tools to facilitate their learning has been on the rise. Additionally, many tools used in system administration are often held back by steep learning curves while lacking instructions on how they are to be used. One such tool is Puppet, a configuration management tool used to manage and configure systems.

To mitigate the learning curve difficulty, I created a game which teaches its users the basics of the programming language used in Puppet.

The game was evaluated on its usability and suitabilty as a learning tool, receiving very positive feedback.

## Import and Build

The project was built in Unity version 2018.3.14f1. The 'project' directory contains all of the project data and the 'build' directory a Windows executable of the game.

## Game and report

The game is currently available at: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1552344/game/
